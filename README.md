This project was made for the purpose of helping with teadious calculations in labs, and to also practice C++ knowlege.
It is by no means a work of art, it is just something made to help with homework.
I anticipate adding more features if nessisary, such as being able to do more complex calculatiions when solving the uncertanty, and also adding a GUI and resembling a claculaor.
